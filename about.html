		<p>The UP Junior Marketing Association (UP JMA) is a university-wide student organization of over 300 members, based in the College of Business Administration, University of the Philippines, Diliman. Each member of the organization is drawn in by the exceptional and rewarding leadership, marketing, and project management experience the reputable organization embodies and guarantees.</p>

		<p>Throughout its fifty-four years of existence, UP JMA has constantly aimed for nothing less than the best for itself and for all its stakeholders. The passion and drive for excellence of all those who have handled the organization over the years has led it to this point of distinction—that of being one of the country’s premier student organizations.</p>

		<p>Moreover, another attribute to its success is the pride UP JMA takes in its four main thrusts and objectives, ensuring that all projects—from seminars to sports clinics to parties—are planned and executed according to the principles and ideals that the organization stands for.  As a marketing organization, UP JMA puts a premium on all of its relationships with its stakeholders—may it be its members, its beneficiaries (the scholars of the K.I.D.S. program), or its affiliates (such as PMA and PJMA).</p>

		<p>Members are instilled with the knowledge and understanding that marketing is primarily about building mutually beneficial relationships, both internally and externally. The recognition and credit that UP JMA has received are motivators—embellishments on the cake—that continue to push its members to aim higher and strive harder. With all this in mind and heart, and over half a century of prestige behind it, UP JMA continues to push on from its golden jubilee year to a bright and exciting future—because in this organization, we lead.</p>
